## Introduction

    Stroke (also known as a cerebrovascular accident (CVA) or brain attack) is a medical condition in which poor blood flow to the brain causes cell death. Stroke is a serious medical condition that can have severe consequences if not detected and treated early. This project utilizes machine learning algorithms to predict the probability of stroke based on a set of health parameters such as age, gender, hypertension, heart disease, etc. By analyzing these parameters, individuals at a higher risk of stroke can be identified, enabling early intervention and preventive measures.

## Dataset

    The dataset used in this project is sourced from KAGGLE. The dataset is preprocessed and cleaned to ensure data quality and consistency before training the machine learning models.

## Features
  
    **Age**: Age of the individual.
    **Gender**: Gender of the individual (male/female).
    **Hypertension**: Indicates whether the individual has hypertension (1 if yes, 0 if no).
    **Heart Disease**: Indicates whether the individual has heart disease (1 if yes, 0 if no).
    **Marital Status**: Marital status of the individual.
    **Work Type**: Type of work the individual is engaged in.
    **Residence Type**: Type of residence (urban/rural).
    **Average Glucose Level**: Average glucose level in the individual's blood.
    **BMI**: Body Mass Index of the individual.
    **Smoking Status**: Smoking status of the individual (smoker/non-smoker/unknown).
